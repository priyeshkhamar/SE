Q - 8. What is SQL Key Constraints? Explain writing an example of SQL Key Constraints.
Ans.

Key constraints in SQL are restrictions that apply to columns in a table to ensure uniqueness and consistency. 
There are three main types of key constraints:

1. Primary Key
A primary key constraint ensures that each record in a table is uniquely identified. 
It checks that the column or collection of columns specified as the primary key does not contain duplicate or null entries. 
Each table may have only one primary key constraint.

2. Unique Key
A unique key constraint assures that the values in the provided column(s) are unique across all rows of the table. 
A unique key constraint, unlike a primary key, allows for null values, but only one per column.

3. Foreign Key
A foreign key constraint defines a relationship between two tables. 
It ensures that the values in a column or columns in one table correspond to the primary key or unique key columns in another table. This constraint ensures that the connected tables have consistent references.

Example:

-- Creating a table with primary key constraint
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    DepartmentID INT
);

-- Creating a table with unique key constraint
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE
);

-- Creating a table with foreign key constraint
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EmployeeID INT,
    OrderDate DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (EmployeeID) REFERENCES Employees(EmployeeID)
);
